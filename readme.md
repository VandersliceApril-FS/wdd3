# Milestone 3: Development
The first version of an idea I had for an app that totals everything on your shopping list as you add items. It's built using HTML, Bootstrap, and Javascript. This was my first experience with the benefits and limitations of Bootstrap.

## Focus
Leveling up from previous projects by learning more about image optimization and using a framework. 

### Image Optimization

Since my project will include user uploaded images, image optimization will be important. 


### Bootstrap
- do not edit the provided CSS files from Bootstrap. Intead, create your own CSS fild and make changes within.
