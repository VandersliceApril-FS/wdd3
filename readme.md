# Milestone 3: Development

Using the website design created in weeks 1 and 2, I'll start building out the project using what I've learned about Bootstrap this week. The project will be glitch and bug free and functional for all users regardless of device size.

## Focus
Leveling up from previous projects by learning more about image optimization and using a framework. 

### Image Optimization

Since my project will include user uploaded images, image optimization will be important. 


### Bootstrap
- do not edit the provided CSS files from Bootstrap. Intead, create your own CSS fild and make changes within.
